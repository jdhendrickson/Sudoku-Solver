This is a project I started working on after getting frustrated with the way the sudoku app
I have on my phone treats the 'Add notes' feature. As such, I've decided to create my own 
version. Theoretically, this project will be able to work on any size sudoku puzzle, from
the standard 9x9, to the miniature 2x2, to the massive 16x16. This will not yet work on the 
non-standard puzzle, which consists of 5 sudokus that are linked.
